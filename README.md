## Welcome to Dana Clark's ePortfolio!

### Thank you for taking the time to look at my page to see what I have accomplished so far.  My career change to become a software engineer is exciting and I hope you will be able to see that despite that I am a newbie in this field.

SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING
The following code was created in order to demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  For this code I took a program written in C++ and port it JAVA and also enhanced its features along with including several security measures such as making sure every ID was unique.
