## Welcome to Dana Clark's ePortfolio!

### Thank you for taking the time to look at my page to see what I have accomplished so far.  My career change to become a software engineer is exciting and I hope you will be able to see that despite that I am a newbie in this field.

CODE REVIEW
The video of my code review is for three different artifacts that I chose for my Capstone.

SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING
The following code was created in order to demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  For this code I took a program written in C++ and port it JAVA and also enhanced its features along with including several security measures such as making sure every ID was unique.

ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURE
The following code was created in order to show the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  For this code I took a program written in Java that only had a zoo authorization system and added a monitoring system that included diaglog windows in which I was able to teach myself and implement into the code.

DATABASES
The following code was created in order to demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. For this code I took several of the queries that I did for my DAD 220 Introduction to SQL class and created PHP's for them so that they could be used on a website.  The website and PHP allows the user to be interactive with the database as opposed to tediously typing in the queries.
