## Welcome to Dana Clark's ePortfolio!

### Thank you for taking the time to look at my page to see what I have accomplished so far.  My career change to become a software engineer is exciting and I hope you will be able to see that despite that I am a newbie in this field.

CODE REVIEW
The video of my code review is for three different artifacts that I chose for my Capstone.  This file is too large to include here so please contact me if you wish to view this video.

SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING
The following code was created in order to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.  For this code I took a program written in C++ and port it JAVA and also enhanced its features along with including several security measures such as making sure every ID was unique.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/anad0314/ePortfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/anad0314/ePortfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
